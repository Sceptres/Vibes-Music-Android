An Android application built using Kotlin, Java, Jetpack Compose, Room Database and MVVM design. This app is used as an offline music player, allowing users to import their songs once and listen anywhere at anytime. The app is also integrated with Google Analytics and Admob ads. The app can be seen on the Google Play Store here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aaa.vibesmusic

2. Open the code in Android Studio and allow the project to build
3. Connect your Google Analytics by copying `google-services.json` into the app folder
